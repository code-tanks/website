Navigate to the code-tanks template repo for the language of your choice and click the green "*Use this template*" button.

Clone the repository you have just made to your local machine.

The recommended IDE for code-tanks is VSCode, which offers [development containers](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-a-dev-container-configuration/introduction-to-dev-containers) allowing easy setup for different environments. If you prefer to install required libraries directly to your system, follow the installation steps provided in `/.devcontainer/Dockerfile` of any template repositories listed above.

That's it! Head over to [Your First Tank](../tutorial-basics/your-first-tank.md) to get started.

## (Optional) Desktop Requirements

sudo apt install -y curl jq pkg-config libasound2-dev libudev-dev

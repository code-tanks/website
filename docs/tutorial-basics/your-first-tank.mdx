You will edit the file within `tanks/` to create your tank. You may create as many tanks as you wish, however each tank's code must be in its own file and follow some basic requirements. These are usually the imports at the top of the file, the tank class, the run() and onEvent() tank methods, and the createTank() method that returns a instance of your tank.

This a basic tank that spins and fires. Upon any event, it will spin in the opposite direction.
